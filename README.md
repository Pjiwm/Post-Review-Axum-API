This project was made to try out Axum in Rust to make a functional REST api.
## Goals for this project
- [x] Connect to a database
- [x] CRUD requests
- [x] several models
- [x] encrypt passwords of users
- [x] use jsonwebtokens for requests
- [ ] middleware
- [x] a model with complex datatypes (time, lists e.g.)

- [ ] deployment
- [ ] only send back certain variables instead of entire object (hide passwords when requesting users for example)
